# Pok√©gen.PkHex

ASP.Net Core REST API providing PkHex & ALM functionality

## Getting Started

### Routes

#### Get Pokemon Data (including Legality Checks)
- `/showdown` 
  
  Expects JSON Body with `showdownSet` property which contains an [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) set.

- `/url`

  Expects a Query parameter named `url` containing the url of the Pokemon file, Optional, the size of the file if already known ahead of making a request.

- `/file`

  Expects a Multipart form parameter called `file` which contains a Pokemon file.

These endpoints all are `GET` endpoints (`/showdown` & `/file` also accept `POST` requests because of browser compatibility) & return the Pokemon Data with `application/octet-stream` MIME type.	

#### Legality Checks
- `/showdown/legality`

  Expects JSON Body with `showdownSet` property which contains an [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) set.

- `/url`

  Expects a Query parameter named `url` containing the url of the Pokemon file, Optional, the size of the file if already known ahead of making a request.

- `/file`

  Expects a Multipart form parameter called `file` which contains a Pokemon file.

These endpoints all are `GET` endpoints (`/showdown` & `/file` also accept `POST` requests because of browser compatibility) & return either `204 No Content` if Legal or `400 Bad Request` if they are illegal.
