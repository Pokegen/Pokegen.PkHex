# Pok√©gen.PkHex

ASP.Net Core REST API providing PKHeX & ALM functionality

## Getting Started

This API currently supports creating pokemon files (.pk*, .pb* etc.) from Showdown Sets via [ALM](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Plugins), checking legality of Showdown Sets/Pokemon files via [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX) & getting trainer data from the data block!

For a full overview of all routes you want to set the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to `Development` which should expose an Swagger (OpenAPI integration) page at /swagger/index.html showing all routes and parameters.

## Deployment
